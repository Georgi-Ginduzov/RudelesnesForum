## Project Overview

This solution implements a web-based forum with automatic moderation of rude comments via real-time sentiment analysis. The application is built in C# on .NET Core, with a dedicated folder for ML training scripts. Users post comments that are classified as “Clean” or “Rude,” and potentially rude comments are held for moderator review.

---

## Features

* **Real-time Sentiment Analysis:** Automated classification of every user comment.
* **Immediate Publishing:** Clean comments appear instantly in the discussion.
* **Moderator Queue:** Rude or uncertain comments are flagged for manual approval.
* **Role Management:** Administrators can activate/deactivate accounts and assign moderator rights.
* **Extensible ML Model:** Training scripts in `Env/ML` allow retraining or swapping the sentiment model.

---

## Technology Stack

* **Framework:** .NET Core 6.0+
* **Language:** C#
* **Front-end:** ASP.NET Core Razor Pages with SCSS and JavaScript
* **Database:** SQL Server (LocalDB or full) via Entity Framework Core
* **ML Scripts:** Python (.ipynb or .py) in `Env/ML`

## Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ````bash
   git clone https://github.com/Georgi-Ginduzov/RudelesnesForum.git
   ``` ([github.com](https://github.com/Georgi-Ginduzov/RudelesnesForum))
   ````
2. **Open the solution:** Launch `Forum.sln` in Visual Studio 2022 (or later).
3. **Restore dependencies:** Visual Studio will prompt to restore NuGet packages; allow it.
4. **Database preparation:**

   * Ensure SQL Server (or LocalDB) is installed and running.
   * Update the connection string in `Forum.Web/appsettings.json`.
   * From the **Package Manager Console**, select **Forum.Web** as the Default Project and run:

     ```powershell
     Update-Database
     ```

---

## Configuration

Edit `Forum.Web/appsettings.json` to include your database and model paths:

```json
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "DefaultConnection": "Server=(localdb)\\mssqllocaldb;Database=RudeForumDb;Trusted_Connection=True;"
  },
  "SentimentModelPath": "Env/ML/sentiment_model.pkl"
}
```

* **DefaultConnection:** Connection string for EF Core.
* **SentimentModelPath:** Path to the trained model file generated by the ML scripts.

---

## Running the Application

1. In Visual Studio, set **Forum.Web** as the startup project.
2. Press **F5** or click **Run** (HTTPS profile).
3. Navigate to `https://localhost:5001`.
4. Register a new user, post comments, and observe moderation behavior.

---

## Machine Learning Model Training

Training scripts and notebooks are located in the `Env/ML` folder. ([github.com](https://github.com/Georgi-Ginduzov/RudelesnesForum))

1. **Prepare your Python environment:**

   ```bash
   cd Env/ML
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. **Label data:** Ensure you have a CSV with `Text,Label` columns.
3. **Train the model:** Run the training script or notebook:

   ```bash
   python train_sentiment.py
   ```
4. **Output:** A model file (e.g. `sentiment_model.pkl`) will be created—referenced by `SentimentModelPath`.

---

## Moderation Workflow

1. **User submits** a comment via the forum UI.
2. **SentimentService** invokes the ML model; comments classified as “Rude” are marked **Pending**.
3. **Clean** comments are stored with **Approved** status and displayed immediately.
4. **Moderators** review pending comments in the **Moderator Dashboard**, choosing Approve or Reject.
5. **Approved** comments become visible; **Rejected** ones are discarded.
